# Gmail Signature Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup Steps

1. **Open the signature file**
   - Open `gmail-signature.html` in any text editor
   - Select and copy ALL the HTML code (starting from the `<table>` tag)

2. **Go to Gmail Settings**
   - Open Gmail in your browser
   - Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the top right
   - Select "See all settings"

3. **Add Your Signature**
   - Scroll down to the "Signature" section
   - Click "Create new" or select an existing signature to edit
   - In the signature editor, click the formatting toolbar to switch to HTML mode (look for `</>` icon or "Insert" → "HTML")
   - Paste the copied HTML code
   - Click "Save Changes" at the bottom of the page

4. **Set as Default (Optional)**
   - In the "Signature" section, choose your new signature from the dropdown for "For new emails use:"
   - You can also set it for replies/forwards

## Important Notes

- **Image URL**: Make sure `https://www.modron.com/MODRON_ICON.png` is accessible. If your site isn't live yet, you may need to:
  - Host the image elsewhere (like imgur, or your hosting provider)
  - Update the image URL in the HTML code
  - Or temporarily remove the image until your site is live

- **Customization**: You can edit the signature in Gmail's editor after pasting, but for best results, edit the HTML file and re-paste.

- **Testing**: Send yourself a test email to verify the signature appears correctly.

## Alternative: Text-Only Version

If images don't work, you can use this text-only version:
